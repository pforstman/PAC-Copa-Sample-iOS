/**
* A class that initializes payment services for applications requiring the purchase of items, such as pay per view (PPV) media, and handles the processing of PPV payments and tokens. Application developers can verify an item can be purchased, initiate payment process and purchase an item. 

**Note:**When testing the PPV logic flow, the device cannot be connected to a debugger on iOS. A debugger will prevent the logic flow from working.
